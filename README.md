## LinkedinEasyApply

This app I have created few months back to apply to jobs on linkedin which has the option for Easy Apply. I have automated the whole process of job application using Python and selenium. 

# Requirement

1. Install Selenimum. I have used pip3 install selenium since I had the latest version of pip. 
Note: pip install selenium works fine too if you haven't updated to lates version of pip.

2. To automate with selenium, it requires a browser to communicate with. You can use Chrome, Firefox, safari or Edge. Search on google for available pborwser for your machine and make sure you enter the driver path in the config.json file under driver_path.

I have used [Chrome Driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) here.

# Run
You can clone or download the repository and change the config.json file as follows:
1. Enter your email used for linkedin
2. Enter your password.
3. Enter the job keyword. Example: Data Analyst, Machine learning Engineer etc.
4. Driver path where it is located on your machine.
Run main.py

This program was run for premium account. Feel free to reach out for any help.
